# Hands-on Terraform-01 : Terraform Installation and Basic Operations

Purpose of the this hands-on training is to give students the knowledge of basic operations in Terraform.

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of the this hands-on training, students will be able to;

- Install Terraform

- Build AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

## Outline

- Part 1 - Install Terraform

- Part 2 - Build AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

## Part 1 - Install Terraform

- Launch an EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI with security group allowing SSH connections.

- Connect to your instance with SSH.

```bash
ssh -i .ssh/call-training.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-133-106-98.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com
```

- Update the installed packages and package cache on your instance.

```bash
$ sudo yum update -y
```

- Install yum-config-manager to manage your repositories.

```bash
$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
```
- Use yum-config-manager to add the official HashiCorp Linux repository to the directory of /etc/yum.repos.d.

```bash
$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/AmazonLinux/hashicorp.repo
```

- Install Terraform.

```bash
$ sudo yum -y install terraform
```

- Verify that the installation

```bash
$ terraform version
```
- list Terraform's available subcommands.

```bash
$ terraform -help
Usage: terraform [-version] [-help] <command> [args]

The available commands for execution are listed below.
The most common, useful commands are shown first, followed by
less common or more advanced commands. If you are just getting
started with Terraform, stick with the common commands. For the
other commands, please read the help and docs before usage.

Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
...

```

- Add any subcommand to terraform -help to learn more about what it does and available options.

```bash
$ terraform -help apply
or
$ terraform apply -help
```

## Part 2 - Build AWS Infrastructure with Terraform

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account.

- The AWS CLI installed. 

- Your AWS credentials configured locally. 

```bash
$ aws configure
```

- Hard-coding credentials into any Terraform configuration is not recommended, and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system. Using AWS credentials in EC2 instance is not recommended.

- We will use IAM role (temporary credentials) for accessing your AWS account. 

### Create a role in IAM management console.

- Secure way to make API calls is to create a role and assume it. It gives temporary credentials for access your account and makes API calls.

- Go to the IAM service, click "roles" in the navigation panel on the left then click "create role". 

- Under the use cases, Select `EC2`, click "Next Permission" button.

- In the search box write EC2 and select `AmazonEC2FullAccess` then click "Next: Tags" and "Next: Reviews".

- Name it `terraform`.

- Attach this role to your EC2 instance. 

### Write your first configuration

- The set of files used to describe infrastructure in Terraform is known as a Terraform configuration. You'll write your first configuration file to launch a single AWS EC2 instance.

- Each configuration should be in its own directory. Create a directory ("terraform-aws") for the new configuration and change into the directory.

```bash
$ mkdir terraform-aws && cd terraform-aws && touch main.tf
```

- Install the `HashiCorp Terraform` extension in VSCode.

- Create a file named `main.tf` for the configuration code and copy and paste the following content. 

```t
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "4.8.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
  # access_key = "my-access-key"
  # secret_key = "my-secret-key"
  ## profile = "my-profile"
}

resource "aws_instance" "tf-ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    "Name" = "created-by-tf"
  }
}
```

- Explain the each block via the following section.

### Providers

The `provider` block configures the name of provider, in our case `aws`, which is responsible for creating and managing resources. A provider is a plugin that Terraform uses to translate the API interactions with the service. A provider is responsible for understanding API interactions and exposing resources. Because Terraform can interact with any API, you can represent almost any infrastructure type as a resource in Terraform.

The `profile` attribute in your provider block refers Terraform to the AWS credentials stored in your AWS Config File, which you created when you configured the AWS CLI. HashiCorp recommends that you never hard-code credentials into `*.tf configuration files`.

- Note: If you delete your AWS credentials from provider block, Terraform will automatically search for saved API credentials (for example, in ~/.aws/credentials) or IAM instance profile credentials. 

### Resources

The `resource` block defines a piece of infrastructure. A resource might be a physical component such as an EC2 instance.

The resource block must have two required data for EC2. : the resource type and the resource name. In the example, the resource type is `aws_instance` and the local name is `tf-ec2`. The prefix of the type maps to the provider. In our case "aws_instance" automatically tells Terraform that it is managed by the "aws" provider.

The arguments for the resource are within the resource block. The arguments could be things like machine sizes, disk image names, or VPC IDs. For your EC2 instance, you specified an AMI for `Amazon Linux 2` and instance type will be `t2.micro`.

### Initialize the directory

When you create a new configuration you need to initialize the directory with `terraform init`.

- Initialize the directory.

```bash
$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding hashicorp/aws versions matching "3.69.0"...
- Installing hashicorp/aws v3.9.0...
- Installed hashicorp/aws v3.9.0 (signed by HashiCorp)

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

Terraform downloads the `aws` provider and installs it in a hidden subdirectory (.terraform) of the current working directory. The output shows which version of the plugin was installed.

- Show the `.terraform` folder and inspect it.

### Create infrastructure

- Run `terraform plan`. You should see an output similar to the one shown below.

```bash
$ terraform plan

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_instance.sample-resource will be created
  + resource "aws_instance" "tf-ec2" {
      + ami                          = "ami-04d29b6f966df1537"

        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if "terraform apply" is subsequently run.
```

- This output shows the execution plan, describing which actions Terraform will take in order to change real infrastructure to match the configuration. 

- Run `terraform apply`. You should see an output similar to the one shown above.

```bash
terraform apply
```

- Terraform will wait for your approval before proceeding. If anything in the plan seems incorrect it is safe to abort (ctrl+c) here with no changes made to your infrastructure.

- If the plan is acceptable, type "yes" at the confirmation prompt to proceed. Executing the plan will take a few minutes since Terraform waits for the EC2 instance to become available.

```txt
Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Creating...
aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Still creating... [30s elapsed]
aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Still creating... [40s elapsed]
aws_instance.tf-example-ec2: Creation complete after 43s [id=i-080d16db643703468]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
```

- Visit the EC2 console to see the created EC2 instance.

### Inspect state

- When you applied your configuration, Terraform fetched data from resources into a file called terraform.tfstate. It keeps track of resources' metadata.

### Manually Managing State

- Terraform has a command called `terraform state` for advanced state management. For example, if you have a long state file (detailed) and you just want to see the name of your resources, which you can get them by using the `list` subcommand.

```bash
$ terraform state list
aws_instance.tf-ec2
```

### Creating a AWS S3 bucket

- Create a S3 bucket. Go to the `main.tf` and add the followings.

```t
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "4.8.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region  = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "tf-ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0ed9277fb7eb570c9"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  key_name      = "mk"    # write your pem file without .pem extension>
  tags = {
    "Name" = "tf-ec2"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "tf-s3" {
  bucket = "oliver-tf-test-bucket-addwhateveryouwant"
}
```

- Write your pem file without .pem extension and change the "addwhateveryouwant" part of the bucket name. Because bucket name must be unique.

- Run the command `terraform plan` and `terraform apply`.

```bash
terraform plan

terraform apply
```

```txt
Error: Error creating S3 bucket: AccessDenied: Access Denied
        status code: 403, request id: 8C5E290CD1CD3F71, host id: NT6nPSh0nW9rripGZrOAo48qJpZ2yToKCiGxDl6gfKIXY97uVH67lcvBiQjX9bsJRX3cL1oNVNM=
```

- Attach `S3FullAccess` policy to the "terraform" role.

```bash
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

- `-auto-approve` means to skip the approval of plan before applying.

- Go to the AWS console, check the S3 bucket. Then check the `terraform.tfstate` and `terraform.tfstate.backup` file.

- Now we will use `terraform plan -out namewhateveryouwant`. This command will create an execution plan and it will save it in a file. It will be a binary file. Lets comment the EC2 instance resource block.

```bash
terraform plan -out=justs3
```
- Now we have just an S3 bucket in justs3. Check that `terraform.tfstate` file has both ec2 and s3 bucket (real infrastructure). If we apply justs3 file it will delete the EC2 instance and modify the tfstate file. You can save your plans with -out flag. First, you can uncomment the EC2 instance.

```bash
ls -al
 justs3
```

### Destroy

The `terraform destroy` command terminates resources defined in your Terraform configuration. This command is the reverse of terraform apply in that it terminates all the resources specified by the configuration. It does not destroy resources running elsewhere that are not described in the current configuration. 


```bash
terraform destroy
```
