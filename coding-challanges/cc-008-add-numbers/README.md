# Coding Challenge - 008: Add Numbers
The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash script that 
watches the free space of the hard disks.  

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash script that write a Shell Script that adds two numbers if provided as the command Line Argument and if the two numbers are not entered throws an Error Message.

- Expected Output :

1: When parameters are not passed

```bash
./add-number.sh
```
``Where x and y are two nos for which I will print sum``


2: When parameters are correctly passed

```bash
./add-number.sh 4 5
```

``Sum of 4 and 5 is 9``
