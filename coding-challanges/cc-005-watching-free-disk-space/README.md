# Coding Challenge - 005: Watching Free Disk Space

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash script that 
watches the free space of the hard disks.  

## Learning Outcomes

At the end of this coding challenge, students will be able to;

- Analyze a problem, identify, and apply programming knowledge for an appropriate solution.

- Implement conditional statements effectively to solve a problem.

- Implement loops to solve a problem.

- Demonstrate their knowledge of algorithmic design principles by solving the problem effectively.

## Problem Statement

The purpose of this coding challenge is to write a program in bash script that 
watches the free space of the hard disks and warns the user when that free space drops below a given threshold â€“ the value of the threshold is given by the user as a command line argument. Notice that if the program gets no command line argument, a default value is used as the threshold.

- Expected Output :

Using default value for threshold!

Threshold = 30

WARNING: The partition "/dev/root" has used 61% of total available space - Date: Wed Aug 28
